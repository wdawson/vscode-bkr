# Better Kill Ring

This extension is designed to be a better kill ring for VS Code. It can be used with other key maps but bring the full power of kill/yank (and a history) to bear.

### Kill

`⌃ Ctrl` + `k` will kill (remove) the text from your cursor to the end of the line.

### Yank

`⌃ Ctrl` + `y` will yank (paste) the text that you last killed to where your cursor is.

### History

Windows: `⌃ Ctrl` + `⌥ Alt` + `y`
Mac: `⌃ Ctrl` + `⌘ Cmd` + `y`

View the kill ring (history of kills you've done) and choose a kill to yank.
